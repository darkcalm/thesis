Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Organic semiconductors are the centerpiece of several vibrant research fields from single‐molecule to organic electronics, and they are finding increasing use in bioelectronics and even classical polymer technology. The versatile chemistry and broad range of electronic functionalities of conjugated materials enable the bridging of length scales 15 orders of magnitude apart, ranging from a single nanometer (10<jats:sup>−9</jats:sup> m) to the size of continents (10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m). This work provides a taste of the diverse applications that can be realized with organic semiconductors. The reader will embark on a journey from single molecular junctions to thin film organic electronics, supramolecular assemblies, biomaterials such as amyloid fibrils and nanofibrillated cellulose, conducting fibers and yarns for e‐textiles, and finally to power cables that shuffle power across thousands of kilometers.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:p>Carefully targeted modifications to the norbornadiene‐quadricyclane couple should give molecules with great potential for solar energy storage. Here we report the synthesis of derivatives of a well‐studied compound, 2‐cyano‐3‐anisyl norbornadiene (<jats:bold>NBD5</jats:bold>). The conjugation was extended by conversion of the nitrile into acrylonitrile and acrylate derivatives over two steps. Despite red‐shifting the absorbance properties, the metastable quadricyclanes exhibited extremely short lifetimes. Meanwhile, treatment of <jats:bold>NBD5</jats:bold> with acetyl halides in the presence of aluminum trihalides led to the formation of 7‐acetyl norbornenes through a Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement. Subsequent transformations made it possible to synthesise norbornadienes with varying degrees of steric bulk at the 7‐position of the molecular scaffold. It was found that the bulkier this group was, the more stable the quadricyclane form. This reaction sequence allows for the synthesis of norbornadiene derivatives which are more suited to molecular solar thermal applications in domestic heating despite providing a slightly lower energy density.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Devices that can capture and convert sunlight into stored chemical energy are attractive candidates for future energy technologies. A general challenge is to combine efficient solar energy capture with high energy densities and energy storage time into a processable composite for device application. Here, norbornadiene (NBD)–quadricyclane (QC) molecular photoswitches are embedded into polymer matrices, with possible applications in energy storing coatings. The NBD–QC photoswitches that are capable of absorbing sunlight with estimated solar energy storage efficiencies of up to 3.8% combined with attractive energy storage densities of up to 0.48 MJ kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The combination of donor and acceptor units leads to an improved solar spectrum match with an onset of absorption of up to 529 nm and a lifetime (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>1/2</jats:sub>) of up to 10 months. The NBD–QC systems with properties matched to a daily energy storage cycle are further investigated in the solid state by embedding the molecules into a series of polymer matrices revealing that polystyrene is the preferred choice of matrix. These polymer devices, which can absorb sunlight and over a daily cycle release the energy as heat, are investigated for their cyclability, showing multicycle reusability with limited degradation that might allow them to be applied as window laminates.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Molecular photoswitches provide an extremely simple solution for solar energy conversion and storage. To convert stored energy to electricity, however, the photoswitch has to be coupled to a semiconducting electrode. In this work, we report on the assembly of an operational solar-energy-storing organic-oxide hybrid interface, which consists of a tailor-made molecular photoswitch and an atomically-defined semiconducting oxide film. The synthesized norbornadiene derivative 2-cyano-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)norbornadiene (CNBD) was anchored to a well-ordered Co<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>(111) surface by physical vapor deposition in ultrahigh vacuum. Using a photochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy experiment, we demonstrate that the anchored CNBD monolayer remains operational, i.e., can be photo-converted to its energy-rich counterpart 2-cyano-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)quadricyclane (CQC). We show that the activation barrier for energy release remains unaffected by the anchoring reaction and the anchored photoswitch can be charged and discharged with high reversibility. Our atomically-defined solar-energy-storing model interface enables detailed studies of energy conversion processes at organic/oxide hybrid interfaces.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The performance of molecular solar thermal energy storage systems (MOST) depends amongst others on the amount of energy stored. Azobenzenes have been investigated as high‐potential materials for MOST applications. In the present study it could be shown that intermolecular attractive London dispersion interactions stabilize the (<jats:italic>E</jats:italic>)‐isomer in bisazobenzene that is linked by different alkyl bridges. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed, that this interaction leads to an increased storage energy per azo‐unit of more than 3 kcal/mol compared to the parent azobenzene. The origin of this effect has been supported by computation as well as X‐ray analysis. In the solid state structure attractive London dispersion interactions between the C−H of the alkyl bridge and the π‐system of the azobenzene could be clearly assigned. This concept will be highly useful in designing more effective MOST systems in the future.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:p>Employing molecular photoswitches, we can combine solar energy conversion, storage, and release in an extremely simple single molecule system. In order to release the stored energy as electricity, the photoswitch has to interact with a semiconducting electrode surface. In this work, we explore a solar-energy-storing model system, consisting of a molecular photoswitch anchored to an atomically defined oxide surface in a liquid electrolyte and under potential control. Previously, this model system has been proven to be operational under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. We used the tailor-made norbornadiene derivative 2-cyano-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)norbornadiene (CNBD) and characterized its photochemical and electrochemical properties in an organic electrolyte. Next, we assembled a monolayer of CNBD on a well-ordered Co3O4(111) surface by physical vapor deposition in UHV. This model interface was then transferred into the liquid electrolyte and investigated by photoelectrochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy experiments. We demonstrate that the anchored monolayer of CNBD can be converted photochemically to its energy-rich counterpart 2-cyano-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)quadricyclane (CQC) under potential control. However, the reconversion potential of anchored CQC overlaps with the oxidation and decomposition potential of CNBD, which limits the electrochemically triggered reconversion.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:p>The photochromic norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) couple has found interest as a molecular solar thermal energy (MOST) system for storage of solar energy. To increase the energy difference between the two isomers, we present here the synthesis of a selection of benzo-fused NBD derivatives that contain an aromatic unit, benzene, naphthalene or phenanthrene, fused to one of the NBD double bonds, while the carbon atoms of the other double bond are functionalized with donor and acceptor groups. The synthesis protocols involve functionalization of benzo-fused NBDs with bromo/chloro substituents followed by a subjection of these intermediates to a cyanation reaction (introducing a cyano acceptor group) followed by a Sonogashira coupling (introducing an arylethynyl donor group, -C≡CC6H4NMe2 or -C≡CC6H4OMe). While the derivatives have good absorption properties in the visible region (redshifted relative to parent system) in the context of MOST applications, they lack the ability to undergo NBD-to-QC photoisomerization, even in the presence of a photosensitizer. It seems that loss of aromaticity of the fused aromatics is too significant to allow photoisomerization to occur. The concept of destroying aromaticity of a neighboring moiety as a way to enhance the energy density of the NBD/QC couple thus needs further structural modifications, in the quest for optimum MOST systems.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The exponential proliferation of data during the information age has required the continuous exploration of novel storage paradigms, materials, and devices with increasing data density. As a step toward the ultimate limits in data density, the development of an electrically controllable single‐molecule memristive element is reported. In this device, digital information is encoded through switching between two isomer states by applying a voltage signal to the molecular junction, and the information is read out by monitoring the electrical conductance of each isomer. The two states are cycled using an electrically controllable local‐heating mechanism for the forward reaction and catalyzed by a single charge‐transfer process for the reverse switching. This single‐molecule device can be modulated in situ, is fully reversible, and does not display stochastic switching. The <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>–<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> curves of this single‐molecule system also exhibit memristive character. These features suggest a new approach for the development of molecular switching systems and storage‐class memories.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The development of cheap and robust heterogeneous catalysts for the Meerwein‐Ponndorf‐Verley (MPV) reduction is desirable due to the difficulties in product isolation and catalyst recovery associated with the traditional use of homogeneous catalysts for MPV.

The reaction is efficient and has a broad substrates scope (19 entries). The products can be isolated by simple filtration, and the catalyst can be regenerated. With the use of microwave heating, we can direct the heating to the catalyst rather than to the whole reaction medium. Furthermore, DFT was used to study the reaction mechanism, and we can conclude that a dual‐site mechanism is operative where the aldehyde and 2‐propoxide are situated on two adjacent Al sites during the reduction. Additionally, volcano plots were used to rationalize the reactivity of Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in comparison to other metal oxides.</jats:p>

<jats:p>Triplet–triplet annihilation photon upconversion (TTA-UC) in solid state assemblies are desirable since they can be easily incorporated into devices such as solar cells, thus utilizing more of the solar spectrum. Realizing this is, however, a significant challenge that must circumvent the need for molecular diffusion, poor exciton migration, and detrimental back energy transfer among other hurdles. Here, we show that the above-mentioned issues can be overcome using the versatile and easily synthesized oxotriphenylhexanoate (OTHO) gelator that allows covalent incorporation of chromophores (or other functional units) at well-defined positions. To study the self-assembly properties as well as its use as a TTA-UC platform, we combine the benchmark couple platinum octaethylporphyrin as a sensitizer and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) as an annihilator, where DPA is covalently linked to the OTHO gelator at different positions. We show that TTA-UC can be achieved in the chromophore-decorated gels and that the position of attachment affects the photophysical properties as well as triplet energy transfer and triplet–triplet annihilation. This study not only provides proof-of-principle for the covalent approach but also highlights the need for a detailed mechanistic insight into the photophysical processes underpinning solid state TTA-UC.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ability to detect proteins through gating conductance by their unique surface electrostatic signature holds great potential for improving biosensing sensitivity and precision. Two challenges are: (1) defining the electrostatic surface of the incoming ligand protein presented to the conductive surface; (2) bridging the Debye gap to generate a measurable response. Herein, we report the construction of nanoscale protein‐based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations; this allowed us to control the local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulate the conductance gating effect upon binding incoming protein targets. Using a β‐lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the capture protein attached to carbon nanotube field effect transistors in different defined orientations. Device conductance had influence on binding TEM‐1, an important β‐lactamase involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Conductance increased or decreased depending on TEM‐1 presenting either negative or positive local charge patches, demonstrating that local electrostatic properties, as opposed to protein net charge, act as the key driving force for electrostatic gating. This, in turn can, improve our ability to tune the gating of electrical biosensors toward optimized detection, including for AMR as outlined herein.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The norbornadiene (NBD)‐quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch has recently attracted attention due to its use in molecular solar thermal energy systems (MOST). Normally for device testing, several grams are needed. One way of synthesizing NBDs efficiently is through the Diels‐Alder reaction between alkynes and cyclopentadiene. However, scaling up the reaction can be troublesome in a research lab environment. Also, dicyclopentadiene needs cracking before utilization which is a time‐consuming step. Here, we developed a method where we both scale up the synthesis in a single reaction step that involves both <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> cracking of dicyclopentadiene and the direct reaction of cyclopentadiene with acetylene derivatives using a tubular coiled stainless steel flow reactor. As a proof‐of‐concept, we synthesized six different NBD compounds and scaled the synthesis to produce 87 g of a novel NBD in 9 h. The NBD is further characterized, showing promising properties for MOST applications. Our new method shows that flow chemistry is an attractive technique for the fast and efficient synthesis of large quantities of NBDs, needed to develop future real‐life devices and applications.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Photoswitchable molecules‐based solar thermal energy storage system (<jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold>) can potentially be a route to store solar energy for future use. Herein, the use of a multijunction <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> device that combines various photoswitches with different onsets of absorption to push the efficiency limit on solar energy collection and storage is explored. With a parametric model calculation, it is shown that the efficiency limit of <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> concept can be improved from 13.0% to 18.2% with a double‐junction system and to 20.5% with a triple‐junction system containing ideal, red‐shifted <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> candidates. As a proof‐of‐concept, the use of a three‐layered <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> device is experimentally demonstrated. The device uses different photoswitches including a norbornadiene derivative, a dihydroazulene derivative, and an azobenzene derivative in liquid state with different <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold>properties, to increase the energy capture and storage behavior. This conceptional device introduces a new way of thinking and designing optimal molecular candidates for <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold>, as much improvement can be made by tailoring molecules to efficiently store solar energy at specific wavelengths.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Leuco dye‐based thermochromic materials offer enormous potential for visible molecular logic due to the appealing reversible color‐changing effect. The stable color state is uncontrollable as it depends only on the spontaneous protonation of the leuco dye and color developer. There is still a challenge to propose an effective approach to control bistable color function at required temperature. A family of azobenzenes with various alkyl chains (AZO(n)) is designed for protonation competition with leuco dye. The hydrogen bond and Van der Waals forces are formed between color developer and AZO(n). The color developer can be locked to provide the proton for the leuco dye by <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>‐AZO(n), while it can be released upon <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>‐to‐<jats:italic>E</jats:italic> photoisomerization. The locked state can be lasted for more than 16 hours. This optically controlled leuco dye‐based system demonstrates a visible sequential logic operation with four‐input signals, and provides a new type of protonation‐based optical control.</jats:p>

In this paper, we perform a large scale screening of approximately half a million bicyclic diene photoswitches in the context of molecular solar thermal energy storage using ab initio quantum chemical methods. We further device an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on their predicted solar energy conversion efficiency and elucidate potential pitfalls of this approach. Our search through the chemical space of bicyclic dienes reveals systems with unprecedented solar energy conversion efficiencies and storage densities that show promising design guidelines for next generation molecular solar thermal energy storage systems.</jats:p>

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Photoswitchable molecules have garnered considerable attention for their versatility and diverse applications, spanning from solar energy harvesting and storage to drug delivery and molecular motors. The chemical conversions that make photoswitches a desirable system are driven by specific wavelengths of light, which often demand intricate molecular modifications. An alternative approach to achieve the photoisomerization reaction is through energy transfer with photosensitizers. Photosensitizers play a pivotal role in various light‐induced processes and have demonstrated successful applications in photodynamic therapy, dye‐sensitized solar cells, and activating photochemical reactions. Therefore, combining photoswitching systems with sensitizers presents an attractive alternative for advancing light‐responsive material design and enabling innovative light‐controlled technologies. This review summarizes the energy transfer mechanisms and strategies involved in sensitized molecular photoswitchable systems, emphasizing the performance of various combined systems, and potential applications. Furthermore, recent advances and emerging trends in this field are also discussed, offering insights into prospective future directions for the development of light‐responsive materials.</jats:p>

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage systems are getting increased attention related to renewable energy storage applications. Particularly, 2,3‐difunctionalized norbornadiene‐quadricyclane (NBD‐QC) switches bearing a nitrile (CN) group as one of the two substituents are investigated as promising MOST candidates thanks to their high energy storage densities and their red‐shifted absorbance. Moreover, such NBD systems can be prepared in large quantities (a requirement for MOST‐device applications) in flow through Diels‐Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and appropriately functionalized propynenitriles. However, these acetylene precursors are traditionally prepared in batch from their corresponding acetophenones using reactive chemicals potentially leading to health and physical hazards, especially when working on a several‐grams scale. Here, we develop a multistep flow‐chemistry route to enhance the production of these crucial precursors. Furthermore, we assess the atom economy (AE) and the E‐factor showing improved green metrics compared to classical batch methods. Our results pave the way for a complete flow synthesis of NBDs with a positive impact on green chemistry aspects.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>1/2</jats:italic></jats:sub>&lt;4 days; ΔH~270 kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene‐based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3‐unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half‐life of the metastable form up to 14 days at 20 °C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development. We also highlight that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry does not only enable to monitor the different stereoisomers during the photoisomerization process as traditionally done, but also allows to determine the thermal back‐isomerization kinetics.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high‐energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as <jats:styled-content>MO</jats:styled-content>lecular <jats:styled-content>S</jats:styled-content>olar <jats:styled-content>T</jats:styled-content>hermal (MOST)‐systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back‐conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts’ activity and monitoring the conversion using UV‐Visible (UV‐Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:p>We report the lowest recorded levels of 1/f noise for graphene-based devices, at the level of SV/V2=SI/I2=4.4×10−16 (1/Hz), measured at f = 10 Hz (SV/V2=SI/I2 &amp;lt; 10−16 1/Hz for f &amp;gt; 100 Hz) in large-area epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide (epigraphene) Hall sensors. This performance is made possible through the combination of high material quality, low contact resistance achieved by edge contact fabrication process, homogeneous doping, and stable passivation of the graphene layer. Our study explores the nature of 1/f noise as a function of carrier density and device geometry and includes data from Hall sensors with device area range spanning over six orders of magnitude, with characteristic device length ranging from L = 1 μm to 1 mm. In optimized graphene Hall sensors, we demonstrate arrays to be a viable route to improve further the magnetic field detection: a simple parallel connection of two devices displays record-high magnetic field sensitivity at room temperature, with minimum detectable magnetic field levels down to Bmin = 9.5 nT/√Hz. The remarkable low levels of 1/f noise observed in epigraphene devices hold immense capacity for the design and fabrication of scalable epigraphene-based sensors with exceptional performance.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of two fluorescent norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches, each incorporating two conjugated pyrene units. Expanding on the limited repertoire of reported photoswitchable fluorescent NBDs, we explore their properties with a focus on applications in bioimaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques. While the fluorescence emission of the NBD decreases upon photoisomerization, aligning with what has been previously reported, for the first time we observed luminescence after irradiation of the quadricyclane (QC) isomer. We deduce how the observed emission is induced by photoisomerization to the excited state of the parent isomer (NBD) which is then the emitting species. Thorough characterizations including NMR, UV‐Vis, fluorescence, X‐ray structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems. Notably, one NBD‐QC system exhibits exceptional durability. Additionally, these molecules serve as effective fluorescent stains targeting Aβ plaques in situ, with observed NBD/QC switching within the plaques. Molecular docking simulations explore NBD interactions with amyloid, unveiling novel binding modes. These insights mark a crucial advancement in the comprehension and design of future photochromic NBDs for bioimaging applications and beyond, emphasizing their potential in studying and addressing protein aggregates.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Herein, we report monomeric and dimeric norbornadiene‐quadricyclane molecular photoswitch systems intended for molecular solar thermal applications. A series of six new norbornadiene derivatives conjugated with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and dithiafulvene as the donor unit were synthesized and fully characterized. The photoswitches were evaluated by experimentally and theoretically measuring optical absorption profiles and thermal conversion of quadricyclane to norbornadiene. Computational insight by density functional theory calculations at the M06‐2X/def2‐SVPD level of theory provided geometries, storage energies, UV‐vis absorption spectra, and HOMO‐LUMO levels that are used to describe the function of the molecular systems. The studied molecules exhibit absorption onset ranging from 416 nm to 595 nm due to a systemic change in their donor‐acceptor character. This approach was advantageous due to the introduction of benzothiadiazole and the dimeric nature of molecular structures. The best‐performing system has a half‐life of 3 days with quantum yields over 50 %.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:p>As the global deployment of renewable technologies accelerate, finding efficient ways to store energy will aid in responding to shifting energy demands. A prospective option not only in harvesting solar energy but also in emission‐free heating is MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) energy storage. A central part of MOST applications is to develop methods to release the stored energy. Herein, the Quadricyclane (QC)‐to‐Norbornadiene catalyzed back reaction is explored in a specially designed packed‐bed reactor. Four distinctly sized and purposely synthesized platinum on activated carbon catalysts are studied to trigger the heat release from the energy‐dense QC isomer. The catalysts are fully characterized using a variety of structural, surface, and spectroscopic techniques. Parameters to optimize catalytic conversion and heat release in flow conditions are explored including particle size and packing behavior, flow rates, and molecular residence times. Moreover, using CO pulse chemisorption technique, site time yield values and a turnover number are reported. Complementary to the flow reactions, computational fluid dynamic simulations applying lattice Boltzmann methods to two catalytic packed beds of different size ranges are done to evaluate fluid‐dynamic behavior within the reactor bed to ascertain the ideal particle size and packing density for catalysis in MOST applications.</jats:p>

Coating with gelatin improves the material’s optical transparency by adjusting the refractive indices. The prepared material shows an upconversion of 633 nm red light to 443 nm blue light, indicated by quadratic to linear dependence on excitation power density (non-linearly). Notably, components of this material are physically dis-assembled to retrieve 66 ± 1% of annihilator, at the end of life. Whereas, the residual clean biomass is subjected to biodegradation, showcasing the sustainability of the developed photonics material.</jats:p>

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems, such as the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) pair, combine solar energy conversion, storage, and release in a simple one‐molecule process. The energy‐releasing reaction QC to NBD can be controlled electrochemically. In this study, we used in‐situ photoelectrochemical infrared spectroscopy (PEC‐IRRAS) together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how electron donating (EDG) and electron withdrawing (EWG) groups in the push‐pull system of the MOST pair affect the electrocatalytic properties of the electrochemically triggered back‐conversion. Specifically, we investigated cyano, tosyl, and methyl ester groups as EWGs, and methoxy, dimethylamine, thioether, and diphenylamine groups located in the <jats:italic>para</jats:italic>‐position of a phenyl group as EDGs. We characterized the onset potential, electrochemical stability window, and selectivity. We found that these properties strongly depend on the strength of electron donation of the EDG, as it exclusively locates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and raises its energy level. We obtained the highest selectivity for compounds with <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐methoxyphenyl functionality.</jats:p>

<jats:p>Two low molecular weight acceptor–acceptor norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches functionalized with <jats:italic>meta</jats:italic>‐ and <jats:italic>ortho</jats:italic>‐substituted pyridine and cyano groups are presented. These molecular systems can be converted between four states in response to light, acid, base, and heat. Quantitative conversion to higher energy metastable quadricyclane (QC) photoisomers is achieved upon UV irradiation, with photoisomerization quantum yields of 37% and 24% for <jats:bold>NBD 1</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>2</jats:bold>. The thermal half‐lives, <jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>1/2</jats:sub>, of 70 and 205 days greatly surpass those of previously reported pyridine‐functionalized norbornadiene switches, as well as other acceptor–acceptor systems. In particular, the <jats:italic>ortho</jats:italic>‐positioning of the pyridine has a profound effect on the half‐life; <jats:bold>QC 2</jats:bold> in its unprotonated form has the longest <jats:italic>t</jats:italic><jats:sub>1/2</jats:sub> of 205 days, while protonation to <jats:bold>QCH</jats:bold><jats:sup><jats:bold>+</jats:bold></jats:sup> <jats:bold>2</jats:bold> completely hinders the thermal back conversion, allowing energy to be stored in this state indefinitely. The stored energy can then be released as required upon the addition of a base, followed by thermal reversion to <jats:bold>NBD 2</jats:bold>. The energy storage densities are 162 and 393 kJ kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for <jats:bold>NBD 1</jats:bold> and <jats:bold>NBD 2</jats:bold>, respectively. This approach of multimodal photoswitches can be applied to molecular solar thermal energy storage devices to enable long‐term energy storage and on‐demand controlled release.</jats:p>

                    The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair is a promising system for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. Multichromophoric systems with two or more photoswitches can offer red‐shifted absorption, higher energy densities, and additional functionality. Here, a series of

                    ‐ and
                    <jats:italic>para</jats:italic>
                    ‐substituted NBD dimers bearing methoxy, hexoxy (for solubility), and cyano groups were synthesised and evaluated for their MOST properties. Compared to monomers, the dimers display red‐shifted absorption and improved solar spectrum match, with onsets between 448–488 nm, owing to their donor–acceptor design and extended conjugation. A key finding is the tunable relationship between molecular structure, photoluminescence and photoisomerisation:

                    ‐dimers exhibit efficient fluorescence, whilst

                    ‐dimers are superior photoswitches with quantum yields of isomerisation, Φ

                    , up to 63%. Solvent choice further modulates behaviour; Φ

                    is higher in acetonitrile, whereas fluorescence is more efficient in toluene. This interplay allows tailoring for specific functions. The best‐performing photoswitches were studied in a liquid‐chip device, achieving a record solar conversion efficiency of 2.9%. Catalytic back‐conversion using cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon and macroscopic heat release experiments at 0.1 M yielded a 5.78 °C temperature increase. This first experimental macroscopic heat release of a dimeric system provides important insights into design challenges and opportunities for advancing multichromophoric systems towards MOST applications.

Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Molecular orbital symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining chemical reaction mechanisms. The process of changing chemical reactants into products must transition along a pathway that conserves molecular orbital symmetry to ensure continuity. This principle is so fundamental that reactions that do not conserve symmetry are typically considered “forbidden” due to the high resultant energy barriers. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to electrically catalyze these forbidden transitions when a single molecule is bound between two electrodes in a nanoscale junction. A cycloaddition reaction is induced in a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, converting it to quadricyclane (QC) by utilizing nanoconfinement to place the molecule into a configuration that is far from equilibrium and applying a small voltage to the molecular junction. Traditionally, this reaction can only be induced photochemically due to orbital symmetry selection rules. By directly tracking the reaction dynamics in situ using single‐molecule Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that for this reaction to be electrically catalyzed the molecule must be sterically maneuvered into a configuration near the transition state at the peak of the energy barrier prior to applying the voltage needed to successfully induce the forbidden transition is applied.</jats:p>
