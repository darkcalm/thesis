Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Photoswitchable molecules have garnered considerable attention for their versatility and diverse applications, spanning from solar energy harvesting and storage to drug delivery and molecular motors. The chemical conversions that make photoswitches a desirable system are driven by specific wavelengths of light, which often demand intricate molecular modifications. An alternative approach to achieve the photoisomerization reaction is through energy transfer with photosensitizers. Photosensitizers play a pivotal role in various light‐induced processes and have demonstrated successful applications in photodynamic therapy, dye‐sensitized solar cells, and activating photochemical reactions. Therefore, combining photoswitching systems with sensitizers presents an attractive alternative for advancing light‐responsive material design and enabling innovative light‐controlled technologies. This review summarizes the energy transfer mechanisms and strategies involved in sensitized molecular photoswitchable systems, emphasizing the performance of various combined systems, and potential applications. Furthermore, recent advances and emerging trends in this field are also discussed, offering insights into prospective future directions for the development of light‐responsive materials.</jats:p>
