Abstract:
<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Photoswitchable molecules‐based solar thermal energy storage system (<jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold>) can potentially be a route to store solar energy for future use. Herein, the use of a multijunction <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> device that combines various photoswitches with different onsets of absorption to push the efficiency limit on solar energy collection and storage is explored. With a parametric model calculation, it is shown that the efficiency limit of <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> concept can be improved from 13.0% to 18.2% with a double‐junction system and to 20.5% with a triple‐junction system containing ideal, red‐shifted <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> candidates. As a proof‐of‐concept, the use of a three‐layered <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold> device is experimentally demonstrated. The device uses different photoswitches including a norbornadiene derivative, a dihydroazulene derivative, and an azobenzene derivative in liquid state with different <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold>properties, to increase the energy capture and storage behavior. This conceptional device introduces a new way of thinking and designing optimal molecular candidates for <jats:bold>MOST</jats:bold>, as much improvement can be made by tailoring molecules to efficiently store solar energy at specific wavelengths.</jats:p>
